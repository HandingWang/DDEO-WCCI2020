<h1 align="center">Competition on Offline Data-Driven Evolutionary Optimization</h1>
<h3 align="center">at 2020 IEEE World Congress on Computational Intelligence</h2>
<h5 align="center">19 - 24th July, 2020, Glasgow (UK)</h3>

<p>Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have been a popular optimization tool for two decades in academia. However, the industry applications of EAs to real-world optimization problems are infrequent, due to the strong assumption that objective function evaluations are straightforward and easily accessed. In fact, such objective functions may not exist, instead computationally expensive numerical simulations or costly physical experiments must be performed for evaluations. In more extreme cases, only historical data are available for performing optimization and no new data can be generated during optimization. Such problems driven by only historical data are formulated as offline data-driven optimization problems, which poses challenges to conventional EAs. Although surrogate models that approximate objective functions can be used as function evaluations in EAs to guide the search, the search accuracy is limited by the offline data and cannot be validated or enhanced by sampling new data. The research on offline data-driven evolutionary optimization has not received sufficient attention, although techniques for solving such problems are very practical. One main reason is the lack of benchmark problems that can closely reflect real-world challenges, which leads to a big gap between academia and industries.</p>

<p>In this competition, there are two tracks: single- and multi-objective optimization. We carefully select 4 benchmark problems for each track from two real-world applications (aerodynamic optimization and software configuration tuning). The objective functions of those problems cannot be calculated analytically, but can be calculated by calling a simulation to provide true black-box evaluations for offline data sampling and the final comparison. Participants are required to find the optimal solutions of each benchmark problem based on the provided offline data. To assess the performance of compared algorithms, we will evaluate the found optimal solutions using the same simulation which generates the offline data. </p>

<p><b>Track 1: single-objective optimization (aerodynamic optimization)</b>:<br>
<b>DDSOP1</b>: This problem is a vehicle performance optimization problem, termed car cab design, which has 11 decision variables and 9 objectives.<br>
The decision variables include the dimensions of the car body and bounds on nature frequencies, e.g., thickness of B-Pillar inner, thickness of floor side inner, thickness of door beam, and barrier height. Meanwhile, the nine objectives characterize the performance of the car cab, e.g., weight of the car, fuel economy, acceleration time, road noise at different speed, and roominess of the car.<br>
<b>DDSOP2</b>: This problem aims at structural optimization of the frontal structure of vehicles for crash-worthiness, which involves 5 decision variables and 3 objectives. The decision variables include the thickness of five reinforced members around the frontal structure. Meanwhile, the mass of vehicle, deceleration during the full-frontal crash (which is proportional to biomechanical injuries caused to the occupants), and toe board intrusion in the offset-frontal crash (which accounts for the structural integrity of the vehicle) are taken as objectives, which are to be minimized.<br>
<b>DDSOP3</b>: This problem is an LTLCL switching ripple suppressor with two resonant branches, which includes 6 decision variables and 3 objectives. This switching ripple suppressor is able to achieve zero impedance at two different frequencies. The decision variables are the design parameters of the electronic components, e.g., capacitors, inductors, and resistors. Meanwhile, the objectives of this problem involve the total cost of the inductors (which is proportional to the consume of the copper and economic cost) and the harmonics attenuations at two different resonant frequencies (which are related to the performance of the designed switching ripple suppressor).<br>
<b>DDSOP4</b>: This problem is also an LTLCL switching ripple suppressor but with nine resonant branches, which includes 13 decision variables and 10 objectives. This switching ripple suppressor is able to achieve zero impedance at nine different frequencies. The decision variables are the design parameters of the electronic components, e.g., capacitors, inductors, and resistors. Meanwhile, the objectives of this problem involve the total cost of the inductors and the harmonics attenuations at nine different resonant frequencies.<br>
<p><b>Track 2: multi-objective optimization (software configuration tuning)</b>:<br>
<b>DDMOP1</b>: This problem is a reactive power optimization problem with 14 buses, termed RPOPS, which involves 11 decision variables and 3 objectives. The decision variables include the dimensions of the system conditions, e.g., active power of the generators, initial values of the voltage, and per-unit values of the parallel capacitor and susceptance. Meanwhile, the five objectives characterize the performance of the power system, e.g., active power loss, voltage deviation, reciprocal of the voltage stability margin, generation cost, and emission of the power system.<br>
<b>DDMOP2</b>: This problem is a portfolio optimization problem, which has 10 decision variables and 2 objectives. The data consists of 10 assets with the closing prices in 100 minutes. Each decision variable indicates the investment proportion on an asset. The first objective denotes the overall return, and the second objective denotes the financial risk according to the modern portfolio theory.<br>
<b>DDMOP4</b>: This problem is a neural network training problem, which has 17 decision variables and 2 objectives. The training data consists of 690 samples with 14 features and 2 classes. Each decision variable indicates a weight of the neural network with a size of 14*1*1.  The first objective denotes the complexity of the network (i.e., ratio of nonzero weights), and the second objective denotes the classification error rate of the neural network.</p>
